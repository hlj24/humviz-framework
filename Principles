The principles offered in this framework form a foundation on which project-based visualization pedagogy must be built in order to ensure a stable scaffolding available to all who enter the classroom or engage with students’ work. The qualities of this foundation are based on previous scholarship on digital pedagogy, multiliteracies, and diversity in humanities teaching & research. These principles inform visualization pedagogy by engaging it critically in issues surrounding access, collaboration, digital humanities discourse, undergraduate research, sustainable teaching practices, and public outreach.
