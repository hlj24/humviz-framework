## Design the Assignment

### Assess Source Materials
Format(s)
* Are source materials textual, visual, aural, something else?
* Is their format stable?

Accessibility & Availability
* How will they be made available to students?
* Will students need to gather the materials?
* Will the materials be presented so that students with varying knowledge backgrounds and abilities will be able to understand and use?

Digital or Analog
* Are the sources in digital or analog form?
* Do they need to be digitized?
* Will digitization be part of the students' projects?

Qualitative or Quantitative
* Do they provide qualitative and/or quantitative information?
* Will your analytical approach to these materials be qualitative, quantitative, or both?

Challenges
* Are there additional barriers to students working with these sources, such as language or privacy laws?
* How can these challenges be addressed?

### Identify Audience
* Who is/are the students' audience(s)?

Prior knowledge
* What does/do the audience(s) already know about the project topic(s) already?

Learning goals
* _What_ will audience(s) learn from the project(s)?
* _How_ will they learn through the project(s)?
* What will audience(s) _do_ with their newly acquired knowledge?

Cultural principles
* What kinds of cultural understandings will audience(s) bring to the projects?
* How might these understandings be factored into project development and presentation?

Method(s) of access
* Will the audience(s) have particular needs regarding access to project information & presentation?
* How will the audience(s) access the project(s)?

### Choose Visualization Methods
Consider selecting 1-2  visualization types (see categories below) that you wish students to focus on. Perhaps develop a complementary research question connecting this type to the project's content. Then consider possible methods of visualization and how each might represent your chosen category differently. Is there a method that best supports both research questions?

_Some Possbile Categories_<sup>1</sup>
* Archival - description & organization of objects, materials, people, ideas.
* Dimensional - represents spatially (often in 3D) an object, material, idea.
* Narrative - tells a story about the objects, materials, people, places, ideas using one or more other visualization categories.
* Network - makes explicit through visualization connections between people, places, organizations, objects, ideas, etc.
* Quantitative - visualizes quantitative data and/or analysis usually through graphs and/or charts.
* Spatial - locates objects, people, places, ideas in relationship to one another in space.
* Temporal - displays object(s) in the context of the passage of time.

_Some Possible Methods_
* animation, projection, video
* data & information
* geospatial & deep mapping
* exhibition & interaction
* augmented, alternate, mixed, virtual realities
* modeling & fabrication
* non-linear storytelling


### Develop Project Workflow
Explore possible tools for carrying out your chosen methodology/ies.
* Which tools will fit your principles, resources, and learning goals?
* What are the major steps needed to create the project from start to finish? How do the tools support each step?

Stable, compatible tools
* If you need to use multiple tools, will they be able to interact with one another? If so, how will this be accomplished? If not, how will this be mitigated?

Replicable & extensible pipeline
* Can the proposed pipeline be easily modified to accommodate issues with the current class or to accommodate other possible teaching contexts?
* Can chosen tools be applied across teaching contexts?
* Will content be created, organized, and presented in ways that will make it reusable in future?

Stable, cross-platform format(s)
* How will content move from one platform to another?
* In which formats will content be presented and later preserved?

### Revise Course Structure
Instructional breakdown
* How can the project pipeline be divided into teachable sections?

In-class requirements
* How much time in class will tool learning, research, and project development need?
* How will experimentation and possible failure be factored into this class time?

Syllabus revision
* How will the project, including teaching, development, and presentation fit into the syllabus? Which course content will need to be modified, confined, or excluded to make space for the visualization assignment?


### Establish Evaluation Criteria
Accommodate experimentation & failure
* How can evaluation encourage experimentation and avoid punishing students who "fail" to meet outcome requirements due to experimentation?

Assess both process & product
* Will process and product be weighted in evaluation? How?

Evaluate the group & the individual
* How will accountability be identified and rewarded?
* For which aspects of the project should the group as a whole be made responsible? For which should individuals?

Balance areas of knowledge
* How will skill-based, analytical, or content knowledge be assessed? Will they be weighted?
* How will students focusing on only skill-based, analytical, or content knowledge be graded in comparison to their peers?
