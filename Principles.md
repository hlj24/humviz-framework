The principles offered in this framework form a foundation on which project-based visualization pedagogy must be built in order to ensure a stable scaffolding available to all who enter the classroom or engage with students’ work. The qualities of this foundation are based on previous scholarship on digital pedagogy, multiliteracies, and diversity in humanities teaching & research. These principles inform visualization pedagogy by engaging it critically in issues surrounding access, collaboration, digital humanities discourse, undergraduate research, sustainable teaching practices, and public outreach.

## Principles:

* _Values Digital Creation Process as part of Humanities Knowledge Production;_

Engage students critically with the digital and visual methods by which they are collecting, analyzing, and presenting humanities research. Ask them to present an argument for why they chose (a) particular method(s), to acknowledge inevitable tensions between humanities research & scholarship and digital methodologies/tools, and to explain how they addressed those tensions in their project.<sup>1</sup>

* _Develops Digital, Information, Visual, and/or Meta- Literacies;_

In order to critique both the process and the product, students must cultivate literacies beyond the written word. They must be able to critically engage information systems, visualization and design, and other meta-literacies. Building these literacies into the learning goals and evaluation ensure that they will be able to present well-researched and well-thought-out digital humanities analysis/critique.<sup>2</sup>

* _Supports Accessibility, Scalability, Replicability, and Extensibility;_

Aaron Mauro writes,

> “The undergraduate digital humanities project must emphasize iterability, openness, and extensibility. These projects must be large enough to accommodate an entire class or even generations of cohorts. Research goals must be tokenized into assignment-like tasks that can be repeated and integrated into an aggregated whole, while also fulfilling curricular goals and maintaining appropriate attribution.”<sup>3</sup>

* _Promotes a Collaborative Environment;_

How often do we complete a digital humanities project without seeking out someone else’s expertise? The multiple literacies and skills required to create a digital project requires collaboration. These collaborations foster experimentation, knowledge sharing, and play that directly contribute to a project’s success.<sup>4</sup>

* _Familiarizes Students with (Digital) Research & Scholarship Practices;_<sup>5</sup>

We can put digital methodologies and literacies into practice not only by creating "research based learning" opportunities within visualization assignments but also by encouraging students to develop a "vocabulary to assess" digital scholarship, or a lens with which to critique both their own scholarship and that of others.

* _Encourages Open Engagement with Audiences beyond the Classroom._

Again, Mauro writes,

> “Students are able to make their course work more meaningful by imagining the potential to reach outside of the isolated scholarly tradition of honing their individual talent.”<sup>6</sup> Not only are we drawing interesting audiences when we create public scholarship but for students we are also creating a sense of accomplishment: they can see concrete impacts of their work in both digital and physical spaces.
